<h1>Hello, World!</h1>
<p>My name is Talita... I'm new in all this, still figuring out how everything works, but hopefully you will see a lot of my work here soon.</p>
<p>I'm currently studying Software Engineering at a Brazilian University where I'm seeing mostly C language, although I have better interest on JS (with HTML, CSS and respective frameworks).</p>
<p>I'm already graduated on Marketing, but I decided to start this new degree challenge during COVID restriction times, when I had a lot of spare time and tried a free course about Python.</p>
<p>I have many ideas that I'm very excited about, but I'm trying to calm myself down to start from the easy/silly tasks until I can grow and achieve my goals, even after that I might need help, so I hope I find support in this platform.</p>

<p>I believe there's no better way of learning than practicing, so I hope I can contribute in this community too!</p>
<p>Any tips and guidance is highly appreciated.</p>
