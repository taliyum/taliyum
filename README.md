<h1>Hello, World!</h1>
<p>I'm a Marketing graduate diving into the world of AI and Software Engineering. During the COVID restrictions, I found myself with extra time and decided to explore my passion for creativity and innovation through a free Python course. </p>

<p>As I'm new to this journey, I'm eager to share my work with you all and contribute to the community. I have a lot of exciting ideas I want to develop, but I'm focusing on starting with manageable tasks to build my skills gradually. I welcome any support and guidance as I navigate this learning curve!</p>

<p>I truly believe that the best way to learn is through practice, and I'm excited to learn from my experiences and from all of you. If you have any tips or insights to share, they would be greatly appreciated!</p>


<p>Looking forward to connecting and growing together!</p>
